# Playing Pacman: Building a Reinforcement Learning Agent

Demo on how to build a Deep Q-Network (DQN) [1] using PyTorch [2] with environment provided by OpenAI Gym [3].

## Setup

for Mac: `brew install cmake`

We recommend running the code in a virtual environment with Python > 3.5.x (fully tested on Python 3.6.5):
```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run `jupyter notebook`
